Once you have a clean text in your language of choice, write a function that takes the path to that file as input (the path itself is a string, as you know) and returns a list of lists, where every smaller list represents a sentence with its tokens.

    "Given the better dictionary structure that we created try to determine how precise out current lemmatization approach can be. More precisely, we now have a gold-standard dataset (the connlu file in the [github repository](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-EWT) seen in class) which contains information about the tokens, the POS and lemmas in a text. Use the token + POS information to obtain a lemmatization via the [ENGLAFF](http://redac.univ-tlse2.fr/lexiques/englaff.html)-based lemmatizer; note that you need to rewrite the function \"lemmatizer\" to fit the new data structure in the \"better_d\" variable, and that you have to find a way to convert the POS tag found in the conllu file to match the one found in the ENGLAFF file (or viceversa). How can you measure the precision of our tool?"
